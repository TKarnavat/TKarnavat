Hi, I'm Tanmay
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
An Embedded Software Engineer üíª 
</h2> 

 I graduated from Ryerson University with my bachelors in Electrical Engineering. I am very much dedicated in learning and contributing to the dynamic world of embedded systems.
 Outside my professional endeavors, I'm passionate about giving back to the community and sharing my skills. I serve as a badminton coach, finding joy in coaching young 
 talent to excel in the sport. I also actively participate in community service, contributing to yearly fundraisers for cancer research, food drives and tree planting initiatives.
